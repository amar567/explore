# Keplerian Orbital Elements (Classical Orbital Elements)
- <b>a</b> : Semimajor axis
- <b>e</b> : eccentricity
- <b>i</b> : inclinnation (angle of plane of orbit with equatorial plane)
- <b>$\Omega$</b> :  Right ascesion of assending node [RAAN] (angle of line joining the point where satellite comes above the equatorial plane and origin - with vernal equinox direction { line joining centers of earth and sun on the first day of spring } )
- <b>$\omega$</b> : Argument of perigee ( Angle from ascending node to perigee in the direction of descending node )
- <b>Î½</b> : True anamoly (angle between current location of satellite from perigee in the direction of ascending node)
