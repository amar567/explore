# Satellite tracking

- watching satellites in the sky have always been my favourite unwinding activity.

- One of my favourite apps have been [Heavens above](https://www.heavens-above.com/), which predicts passage of a satellite according to location of the observer, also predicts optical brightness magnitude. 

- I've always wondered how this works under the hood.
